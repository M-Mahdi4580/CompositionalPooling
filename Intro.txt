Summary:
Compositional Pooling System is an implementation of the object pool pattern for Unity's object-oriented framework. It is designed to be efficient while easy to use. Therefore, the system imitates and is a direct substitute for Unity's Object.Instantiate/Object.Destroy API.
To start using the system, import CompositionalPooling namespace and replace desired Object.Instantiate/Object.Destroy calls with respective PoolingSystem.Request/PoolingSystem.Release calls.
The system automatically creates a new pool and initializes it with a default size when the pool is needed to respond to a request or release. To adjust the default size, modify the corresponding constants in the PoolingSystem.cs source file.
To explicitly create, initialize or update a pool, you may use the static PoolingSystem.PoolManager class or you may utilize the given controller classes which provide additional functionality.
By default, the system only supports a handful number of common object compositions. See StateMapperSetup.cs source file for more details.
To add support for more compositions, the system requires a one-time setup comprised of registering object-mapper delegates for the component types constituting the compositions. If request or release involves an unsupported composition, the system reverts back to normal instantiation or destruction which degrades performance.
The system's setup process, although simple, can quickly become tedious and hard to maintain if the number of target components is high or their setup requires frequent updates. MapperGeneratorWindow is an editor tool, capable of generating the required setup code for hundreds of components in the blink of an eye, facilitating this time-consuming process significantly.
PoolAnalyzerWindow is another editor tool which records the system's actions and generates reports that can help you analyze the pools and their usage stats. It can also help you find inefficient or incorrect uses of the system.
The editor tools are only provided in the full version. To access these, open the 'Window' menu and navigate to 'Pooling System' submenu. You can also access these tools from external editor scripts.
